This code implements the gas in free expansion (particles can push the walls without loss of momentum). The pressure is calculated at every time step and compared to the volume.
Theoretically, the expectation relation between the parameters should be:

$$
P = \frac{N k_B T}{V}
$$

Where $N$ is the number of particles and $k_B$ Boltzmann's constant.
